React JS:

A Javascript library for building user interfaces
Front-end ie., runs in browser-Client side library
SPA-Single page Application
Uses JSX(Javascript syntax extension)-Dynamic HTML

Splits tasks to several components
No need to hover to another HTML files everytime we click something-Netflix

root.render(
 <h1>Hello</h1>
)

This is JSX.Looks like HTML
JSX is a tag-based language and very similar to HTML

Render should have only one children but that children of the render can have as many child as we  want.

Fragment-Multiple elements without having one parent element  <>....</>

<br> and <img> needs closing tag <br />

Cannot used reserved keywords
class becomes className
for becomes htmlFor

We can't write everything inside one root.render.So we seggregate our code into Components.

Component:

export default function App(){

}

HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT (HMR) - The page produces the changed output without the need to refresh the whole page.

React keeps the previous structure in memory and only re-render what needs to be re-rendered by using the
Virtal DOM.

Reactive data with Hooks and Components -
